            Now it is such a bizarrely improbable coincidence that anything so mind-bogglingly useful could have evolved purely by chance
            that some thinkers have chosen to see it as the final and clinching proof of the non-existence of God.
            The argument goes something like this: "I refuse to prove that I exist,'" says God, "for proof denies faith, and without faith I am nothing."
            "But," says Man, "The Babel fish is a dead giveaway, isn't it? It could not have evolved by chance. It proves you exist, and so therefore, by your own arguments, you don't. QED."
            "Oh dear," says God, "I hadn't thought of that," and promptly vanishes in a puff of logic.
            "Oh, that was easy," says Man, and for an encore goes on to prove that black is white and gets himself killed on the next zebra crossing.

            A towel, [The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy] says, is about the most massively useful thing an interstellar hitchhiker can have.
            Partly it has great practical value. You can wrap it around you for warmth as you bound across the cold moons of Jaglan Beta;
            you can lie on it on the brilliant marble-sanded beaches of Santraginus V, inhaling the heady sea vapors; you can sleep under it
            beneath the stars which shine so redly on the desert world of Kakrafoon; use it to sail a miniraft down the slow heavy River Moth;
            wet it for use in hand-to-hand-combat; wrap it round your head to ward off noxious fumes or avoid the gaze of the Ravenous
            Bugblatter Beast of Traal (such a mind-boggingly stupid animal, it assumes that if you can't see it, it can't see you);
            you can wave your towel in emergencies as a distress signal, and of course dry yourself off with it if it still seems to be clean enough.
